# my-blog
My blog is an open source wordpress like project.

It's currently being developed, so when we do first release, you will be notified in our <a href="https://discord.gg/jQFY8Dk">Discord</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/danbulant">Patreon</a>.

## Current features
Now, it can do basic things like paging, showing posts and custom pages. I'm currently working on kamaradi, so the development of My blog is paused. **Sorry.**
